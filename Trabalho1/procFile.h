 *  \brief Problem name: Computation of the determinant of a square matrix through the application of the Gaussian
 *                       elimination method.
 *
 *  Synchronization based on monitors.
 *  Both threads and the monitor are implemented using the pthread library which enables the creation of a
 *  monitor of the Lampson / Redell type.
 *
 *  File processing utilities.
 *
 *  It reads the number of matrices whose determinant is to be computed and their order from a binary file. It reads
 *  next the coefficients of each matrix which are stored line wise into an array of buffers. The buffers are then
 *  supplied upon request for processing and the determinant value is returned.
 *
 *  Definition of the operations carried out by the main thread, the dispatcher and the determinant computing threads:
 *     \li openFile
 *     \li readMatrixCoef
 *     \li closeFileAndPrintDetValues
 *     \li getMatrixCoef
 *     \li returnDetValue.
