 *  \file computeDet.h (interface file)
 *
 *  \brief Computation of the determinant of a square matrix through the application of the Gaussian elimination method.
 *
 *  It reads the number of matrices whose determinant is to be computed and their order from a binary file. The
 *  coefficients of each matrix are stored line wise.
 *  The file name may be supplied by the user.
 *  Multithreaded implementation.
 *
 *  Generator thread of the intervening entities and definition of the intervening entities.
 *
 *  SYNOPSIS:
 *  <P><PRE>                computeDet [OPTIONS]
 *
 *                OPTIONS:
 *                 -f name --- set the file name (default: "coefData.bin")
 *                 -h      --- print this help.</PRE>
